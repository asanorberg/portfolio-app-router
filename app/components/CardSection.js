          This was my first project using Tailwind and built with Vite, where I
          aimed to recreate and simplify a section of Zoom's official website.
          <br></br>
          Zoomâ€™s site is dense with information and content so I had to
          thoughtfully decide which elements to retain or omit, while
          incorporating some of my own design ideas.
